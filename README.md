How to run:
There are two ways of running this program:
1. Use the command python batch_run_test.py to run all experiments on all datasets.
   WARNING: Although this is less repetitive, it can run for a very long time due to a few datasets being sizeable. (e.g. HIV dataset with over 30,000 graphs).

2. Run the full_multimodal_project.py to be more selective of datasets and feature combinations to test as it accepts user input.
